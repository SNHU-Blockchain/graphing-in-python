        "- Employ comprehensive logging mechanisms, including code modifications, transactions, and data changes.\n- Fulfill secure digital signatures to ensure the integrity and non-repudiation of transactions or code changes.\n- Monitor and review logs and audit trails to detect suspicious activities or unauthorized modifications.",
        "- Regularly assess and patch vulnerabilities in the platformâ€™s software, frameworks, and dependencies.\n- Utilize secure coding practices, like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or insecure direct object references.\n- Limit the amount of personally identifiable information or sensitive data stored on the platform.",
        "- Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems to detect and block suspicious network traffic.\n- Employ rate-limiting or traffic-shaping techniques to manage incoming requests and prevent resource exhaustion.\n- Monitor system resources and set resource limits to prevent excessive consumption.",
        "- Implement strong access controls and least privilege principles to ensure necessary permissions to individuals.\n- Monitor user activities and implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify privilege escalation attempts.\n- Utilize secure development frameworks, libraries, and components to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities and exploits."
